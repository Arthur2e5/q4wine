Known Issues:
***********************************************
1. Non-standard directories

If you have installed q4wine in a non-standard directory, 
and you get the following error message: "error while loading shared libraries: libq4wine-core.so",
then you need to override LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH={$path_to_q4wine_prefix}/lib/ q4wine

2. Problem with dual qt3 and qt4 qmake installations

CMake, by default, will search for a qmake binary.
On distributions with both qt3 and qt4 libraries installed, you may
need to create symbolic link from "qmake" to "qmake-qt4".

ls /usr/bin:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 2011-07-05 21:07 qmake -> qmake-qt4
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1901408 2011-04-01 19:04 qmake-qt3
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3444152 2011-06-24 17:52 qmake-qt4

3. Problem with dual qt4 and qt5 installations
Make sure you select Qt4 as default Qt version. Install relevant package (e.g. qt4-default in Ubuntu 13.04) if necessary.

Uninstall:
***********************************************
To uninstall q4wine, run the following command from within q4wine's build root:
