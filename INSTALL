Known Issues:
***********************************************
1. Non standart directory

If you have installed q4wine in non standart directory, 
and you get a error message: "error while loading shared libraries: libq4wine-core.so"
then you need to override LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable

LD_LIBRARY_PATH={$path_to_q4wine_prefix}/lib/ q4wine

2. Problem with dual qt3 and qt4 qmake

CMake by default will search for qmake binary.
On distributions with dual qt3 and qt4 libraries installed, you may
need to create symbolic link from qmake-qt4 to qmake binary.

Is /usr/bin:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 2011-07-05 21:07 qmake -> qmake-qt4
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1901408 2011-04-01 19:04 qmake-qt3
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3444152 2011-06-24 17:52 qmake-qt4

Uninstall:
***********************************************
In q4wine build root run:
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
